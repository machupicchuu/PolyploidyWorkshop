# mssel_modified
This folder contains original files from R. Hudson (http://home.uchicago.edu/rhudson1/) to run mssel, a modified version of ms [1] that allows for the incorporation of selection at a single site. This simulation program takes as input the frequency trajectory of the selected allele for each population.

"streecsel.c" has been modified by K. Lee to allow for multiple independent origins of beneficial lineages if migration rate is 0, instead of forcing coalescence (beginning line 260, marked).
